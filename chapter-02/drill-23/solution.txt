Add the following line to the top of Program.cs:
using static System.Console;

Now you do not need to add the word Console. before any of the Console methods or properties. This only applies to that
file. To have this apply to any file in the project, remove the using line at the top and instead open the .csproj file
by double clicking the project name. Then add the following conent inside the project:
<ItemGroup>
	<Using Include="System.Console" Static="true" />
</ItemGroup>

Now you can use Console methods and properties in any file in the project without having to spell out Console. Note you
should do this for all projects going forward, will try to follow this for examples in this book.
