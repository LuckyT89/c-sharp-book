A number like 0.1 can't be accurately represented as a double because it has infinitely repeating numbers. Using a decimal
instead is safe because the decimal type just shifts the decimal place over to make it an integer and then shifts it back. 
For example, 0.1 turns into 1 and then shifts the decimal place back. 

Doubles are ok to use if accuracy is not important or you are only comparing using greater than or less than. Things like
height are usually ok for this. Things like money should use decimals or anything that will have values compared to each
other for equality.
