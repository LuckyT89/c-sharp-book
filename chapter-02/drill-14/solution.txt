The dynamic type should be avoided for the same reasons as using the object type, even more so because it can lead to
even worse performance. Note that when accessing properties like Length, you do not need to use a cast expression like
you do with the object type. It will not have IntelliSense when you write the property name and it is up to you to make
sure the type really does have that property. For example, if you try to use the Length property on a number, it will
not show any issues until you actually run the program and will throw an exception.
