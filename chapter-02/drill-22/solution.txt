Put a ? after the keyword string to remove the first warning. This tells the compiler that we are expecting a possible
null value and that we will handle this possiblity. 

For the second warning, put a ! before the semi colon at the end of the line. This is the null forgiving operator and
says that the method is not going to return null so it does not need to warn us. It will be up to us to make sure this
is true. 

In the case of console apps, ReadLine will always return a string even if it is just an empty string.
