The example code will output the HTML exactly as it is typed and will keep spacing the same. We use three double quotes
at the beginning and end. If there was a place inside the text that needed to use three double quotes in a row for some
reason, we would use four double quotes at the beginning and end instead. If we needed to use four double quotes then we
would use five at the beginning and end and so on.
