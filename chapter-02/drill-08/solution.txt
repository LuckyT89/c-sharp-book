Note that when you write a number with a decimal point, it seems to identify it as a double type. If you want it to be
a float or decimal, you need to add the appropriate suffix at the end of the number even if you are assigning it to a 
float or decimal variable type. It does not seem like you need to do this with integer numbers.
