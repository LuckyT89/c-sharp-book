The $ symbols before the string indicate how many curly braces should be used for interpolation. If you put one $ then 
{} will be read as interpolation. If you put two $ symbols then {{}} will be read as interpolation and so on. This allows
you to set up your string for instances where there are some places you want to have interpolation and some places where
you actually want to dispaly curly braces.
