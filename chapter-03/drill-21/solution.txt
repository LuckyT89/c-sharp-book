Casting just means converting something from one type to another. For example if a user enters a string in the console
and you need to convert it (cast it) to a number.

Implicit casting happens automatically and is safe because you will not lose any information. Explicit casting must be
done manually because you may lose information, such as the precision of a number, and you are saying you are ok with
this.
