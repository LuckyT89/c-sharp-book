When incrementing a number, once it goes above its maximum value, it will overflow to its minimum value and then continue 
incrementing from there. In the solution, before wrapping the code in a checked block it would write four lines to the 
console. After wrapping in a checked block it will throw an exception after the overflow and not write the last line.

Note to make the code more friendly you could wrap all of it in a try catch block and output a nicer message when an 
OverflowException is thrown.
