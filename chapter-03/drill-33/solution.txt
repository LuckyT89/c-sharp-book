Writing the following line will give you a compile time error, underlined in red:
int y = int.MaxValue + 1;

This is because it knows that this will result in an overflow and is trying to warn you. If you wrap the code in an 
unchecked block, you can allow this to happen. View the results and note the behavior. It seems like it is rare that you 
would ever actually use this. 

Also note it seems like compile time is something that happens as you type out code- things that are underlined in red 
before you even run the code are issues found at compile time. Run time is what happens when the code actually runs.
