System.Convert has methods that can be used to convert one type to another. This is an alternative to using the cast
operator. One reason to do this is that when using the cast operator, you can only cast between similar types or between
a class and its subclasses. For example you can cast a long to another whole number type like an int but you can't cast
a long to something like a string or a DateTime. Using System.Convert can do this and it will convert to and from all
number types, booleans, strings, and date and time values.

Note in this example a difference between casting and converting a double. Here converting will round 9.8 up to 10 where
casting 9.8 cut off the decimal and turned it into 9.
