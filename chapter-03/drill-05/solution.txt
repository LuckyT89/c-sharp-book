It seems like conditional logical operators do the same thing as logical operators but they have the ability to short
circuit. They use two symbols instead of one, such as && instead of &. 

They can make your apps more efficient, but they can also introduce subtle bugs in cases where you assume that the
function will always be called. It is safest to avoid them when used in combination with functions that cause side effects.
