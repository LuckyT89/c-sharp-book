C# uses what is called banker's rounding when rounding numbers. Most people are taught that when the decimal part of a 
number is .5 you round the number up. Banker's rounding says that when the decimal part of a number is .5 you round up 
if the non-decimal part is odd and round down if the non-decimal part is even.

Normal rounding examples:
5.5 > 6
6.5 > 7
7.5 > 8
8.5 > 9

Banker's rounding examples:
5.5 > 6
6.5 > 6
7.5 > 8
8.5 > 8

Note if you want you can control how numbers are rounded using the Round method of the Math class.
