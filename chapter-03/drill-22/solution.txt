When casting a double to an int, this is unsafe and could lose information. When the double has a decimal place, it will
cut off anything that comes after the decimal. So 9.8 would just become 9.

Note you can do the same kind of casting between different number types but these can give very strange results when you
do explicit casting. For example, an int can have a max value of just over 2 billion. If you take a long and set it to
5 billion and then explicitly cast it as an in, it will have a value of 705,032,704 which doesn't really make sense. It 
is not as clear as simply removing the decimal place like in the other casting example.
