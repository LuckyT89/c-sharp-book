The normal arrays we work with that contain a list of items are single dimensional arrays. You can have a grid of items
for a two dimensional array or even more, like a cube of items. Then you can use nested loops to go through each item
and do something with it.

Example:
1 2 3
A B C


A jagged array is basically when some dimensions have different lengths and it creates a messy structure.

Example:
A B C D 
1 2 3
