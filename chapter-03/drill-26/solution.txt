When you have a binary object like an image or video that you want to either store or transmit, you sometimes do not
want to send the raw bits because you do not know how those bits could be misinterpreted, for example, by the network 
protocol transmitting them or another operating system that is reading the stored binary object.

The safest thing to do is to convert the binary object into a string of safe characters. Programmers call this Base64 
encoding. The Convert type has a pair of methods, ToBase64String and FromBase64String, that perform this conversion.

Note the binary object in this case is an array of bytes (a byte array!!!)
