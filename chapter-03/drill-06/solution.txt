Basically if you take two variables that are integers and start using the &, |, and ^ operators on them (instead of on
boolean variables as you normally would) they become bitwise operators which looks at the numbers in binary and returns 
results based on if there is a one or zero in each column. 

Shift operators such as << move bits around inside a number and can be used to perform some calculations faster than
using regular arithmetic operators.
