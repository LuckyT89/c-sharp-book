When using switch statements we saw you can do pattern matching on items to check its type or properties. When passing
an array to a switch statement, you can use special pattern matching to check certain things such as is the array empty,
does the array have three items, or does the array start or end with a specific item.

It seems like arrays are good when you have a known number of items you want to temporarily store but if you want to
dynamically add or remove items from the list you should choose another collection such as a list. This seems different
from javascript since we can add and remove things from an array easily.
