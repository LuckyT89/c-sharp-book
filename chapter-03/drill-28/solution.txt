The following code will result in an exception:
int count = int.Parse("abc");

This is because abc can't be converted to a number. You can use the TryParse method to try to handle this. It returns 
true if the string can be converted and false if it can't. It also uses the out keyword to set a variable you are 
trying to update. 

Example:

Write("How many eggs are there? "); 
string? input = ReadLine();
if (int.TryParse(input, out int count))
{
  WriteLine($"There are {count} eggs.");
}
else
{
  WriteLine("I could not parse the input.");
}
