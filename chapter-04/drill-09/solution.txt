Add the additional lines shown in the screenshot. 

There is a Solution Configurations dropdown near the green run triangles in Visual Studio. It should be set to Debug by 
default. Switch it to Release and then run the program without debugging (gree outline triangle). Note there will be a 
file on your desktop and when you open it, it will only have the line from the Trace class. 

Now switch the dropdown back to Debug and run it again, open the file and see that it has both log statements. This shows 
that Debug statements are stripped out automatically when you build the release version of your program.
