In console apps you can define a function by writing it at the bottom of Program.cs and then call it in the middle of 
the file (note it seems you don't have to do this but the book said you do). This creates a local function. Local functions 
have some limitations we will learn about later. Usually it is better to write the function in a separate file as we 
will see later.
