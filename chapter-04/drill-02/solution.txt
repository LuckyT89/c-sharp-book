Give it the name Program.Functions.Class

Erase everything in Program.Function.cs and write in the the code from the screenshot. Now in Program.cs you can call 
the function. 

Notes about the function:
TimesTable must have a byte value passed to it as a parameter named number.
TimesTable can optionally have a byte value passed to it as a parameter named size. If a value is not passed, it defaults to 12.
TimesTable is a static method because it will be called by the static method <Main>$.
TimesTable does not return a value to the caller, so it is declared with the void keyword before its name.
TimesTable uses a for statement to output the times table for the number passed to it with a number of rows equal to size.

You can pass in the name of the parameter as well when you call the function to make it more clear what the values are. 
Here are some possible ways to call this function:

TimesTable(7);
TimesTable(number: 7);
TimesTable(7, 12);
TimesTable(number: 7, size: 12);
